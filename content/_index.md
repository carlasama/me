I’m a Brazilian front-end developer with a passion for creating smooth, accessible, and fun interfaces. I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple and beautiful interactions.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, and I've been working with Vue.js and Laravel since 2021. I’ve also explored Angular, React, and even some game dev — I like to keep things playful and meaningful.

Currently, I’m focused on building projects that mix creativity, usability, and a bit of magic ✨. I believe tech should be empowering, not overwhelming.
