I’m a Brazilian software developer with a focus on front-end and a passion for creating smooth, accessible, and fun interfaces. I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple and beautiful interactions.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, and I’ve been working with Angular since 2021 and Vue.js since 2022. I’ve also explored React and even some game dev — I like to keep things playful and meaningful.

Currently, I’m focused on building projects that mix creativity, usability, and a bit of magic ✨. I believe tech should be empowering, not overwhelming. I also enjoy working with Node.js on back-end projects, crafting efficient and scalable solutions.
