  <h1>My Journey as a Developer: Learning, Fun, and Challenges with ADHD</h1>

  <p>26 May 2024 ‚Äî 3 min read</p>

  <p>Being a developer is a rollercoaster of emotions. Some days, everything clicks, and it feels like I‚Äôm on top of the world. Other days, I struggle to keep my focus and find myself overwhelmed by the endless learning and constant deadlines. As someone with ADHD, it‚Äôs a journey full of both excitement and challenges.</p>
<h2 id="the-thrill-of-learning-and-growing">The Thrill of Learning and Growing</h2>
<p>One thing that truly excites me about being a developer is the never-ending learning process. There‚Äôs always something new‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new framework, a cool tool, or an entirely new paradigm to explore. The problem-solving aspect of coding is like solving puzzles, and when you crack one, it‚Äôs incredibly satisfying. I love the idea that every line of code I write brings me closer to building something meaningful, whether it‚Äôs for a personal project or a client.</p>
<p>What makes this journey even better is when I make learning fun. I‚Äôve always believed that education should be enjoyable. I‚Äôve made it a point to play with new technologies in ways that spark my curiosity. Sometimes, that means making a simple game to learn a new framework or building a quirky project that combines my love for technology and creativity. After all, who says learning can‚Äôt be playful?</p>
<h2 id="the-struggle-with-adhd">The Struggle with ADHD</h2>
<p>But as much as I love what I do, the reality is that ADHD can make it difficult to stay on track. I often find myself jumping between tasks‚Äîone minute I‚Äôm working on a Vue.js component, the next, I‚Äôm deep in a rabbit hole about Go or playing with React. This constant shifting can make it challenging to complete tasks on time or to focus long enough to finish a project. It&rsquo;s frustrating because I know I can do the work, but my mind doesn&rsquo;t always cooperate.</p>
<p>Staying organized is another battle. I try to use tools like Trello and Notion to keep track of my tasks, but without the proper focus, I sometimes find myself drifting from one task to another without completing anything. I‚Äôve had to learn to embrace my rhythm, even when it‚Äôs not linear, and to forgive myself for the days when my brain decides to wander.</p>
<h2 id="finding-balance">Finding Balance</h2>
<p>The key for me has been finding a balance. I need to make sure I‚Äôm working on something that excites me. If the task feels too dull or repetitive, my attention starts to fade, and the struggle becomes harder. That‚Äôs why I try to make my projects as interesting as possible, adding elements that keep me engaged.</p>
<p>I also give myself permission to take breaks when I need them. One thing I‚Äôve realized is that constant pressure doesn‚Äôt work for me. Short bursts of focus, followed by a break to recharge, is often the most productive approach. I‚Äôve also found that being part of a supportive community helps. Whether it‚Äôs fellow developers or friends who understand the challenges of ADHD, having that support system makes all the difference.</p>
<h2 id="the-reward">The Reward</h2>
<p>In the end, the joy of creating something out of nothing‚Äîthe satisfaction of seeing a project come to life after hours of coding‚Äîis worth all the ups and downs. And while the struggle with ADHD can make the process more complicated, it also brings a sense of uniqueness to my journey. I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs okay to not follow a straight path and that success can be found in the messy, non-linear process of growth.</p>
<p>Being a developer isn‚Äôt just about writing code; it‚Äôs about embracing the challenge and making the journey as enjoyable as the destination. After all, we all deserve to have fun along the way, even if the road gets bumpy sometimes.</p>
